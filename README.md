FOSS IP Lookup Tool

Example record
```json
{
  "142.250.141.138": {
    "domains": ["google.com"],
    "ptr": "dd-in-f138.1e100.net",
    "history": [
      "2024-08-11T05:51:58Z": {
        "domains": ["google.com"],
        "ptr": "dd-in-f138.1e100.net"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

History would be nice, but good chance doing that for the entire internet would quickly become unsustainable for a shoestring budget project. TBD.
